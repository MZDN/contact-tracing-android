## Background

On April 10, 2020, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/)  and [Google](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology) announced detailed protocol specifications for **Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing**, making all earlier contact tracing protocols immaterial and enabling constructive activity on life-saving application development.
